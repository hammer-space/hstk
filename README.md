Hammerspace CLI tool and python toolkit (hstk)

Supports Hammerspace release 4.1.0 and later.

# Install

The easiest way to install the hs command + hstk library is with pip.  You may
need to use your package manager (yum/apt/etc) to install the python-pip
package.  Once you have the 'pip' command, decide if you want to install for
all users in the system libraries or for just your account.  

As your user (installs in your account only) or using sudo/root (installs in system directories):

$ pip install hstk

This will pull down the needed dependencies as well.  This does not install the
bash completions like the RPM install method does.
